_Adapted from the [423 MkDocs tutorial](https://comp423-25s.github.io/resources/MkDocs/tutorial/)._

Welcome! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a development container (dev container) in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), for the Rust programming language. Starting from a blank directory, you'll create a basic dev container and write your first Rust program within this environment.
## Prerequisites:

1. **Your own GitHub account:** [Sign up](https://github.com/) if you haven't.
2. **Git:** Got it? Get it [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you don't.        
3. **Visual Studio Code:** Get VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4. **Docker:** Download and install [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
